New York State Energy Transition 

## Scenarios
Each of the four folders includes an Excel file that contains all modeling parameters and input data for one of the four studied scenarios on New York State energy transition optimization. The four scenarios are developed based on the involvement of two factors, carbon price policy and geothermal space heating technologies that include ground source heat pump and geothermal direct use. Specifically, the first scenario assumes that carbon price policies and geothermal space heating technologies exist within the planning horizon. The second scenario does not have carbon price policies and therefore is referred as business as usual (BAU), while geothermal technologies are still available under this scenario. The third scenario assumes that geothermal technologies are not used for space heating during the energy transition, while the carbon price policy exists. In the last scenario, it is assumed that neither carbon price policies nor geothermal space heating technologies exist. 


## Data Files
The first tab of each Excel file is named "outline", which lists the modeling parameters and input data that are included in the data file, as well as their locations in the Excel file given by tab names. For instance, the capital costs of electricty generators are given in tab "CapexE" in the data files.
